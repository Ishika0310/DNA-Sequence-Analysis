# 🧬 DNA Sequence Analysis Toolkit
## 📌 Project Description

The **DNA Sequence Analysis Toolkit** takes a DNA sequence as input and performs multiple biological analyses including validation, nucleotide statistics, GC content calculation, transcription, and translation.

This project demonstrates how **core molecular biology concepts** can be implemented using **Python programming**.

---

## 🔬 Features

- ✅ DNA sequence validation (A, T, G, C only)
- 📏 Sequence length calculation
- 🔢 Nucleotide count (A, T, G, C)
- 📊 GC content percentage
- 🔁 Reverse complement generation
- 🧾 DNA → RNA transcription
- 🧬 DNA → Protein translation using codon table
- ❌ Error handling for invalid sequences
